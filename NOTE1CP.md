#### Will it be the deal of future?

Crypto industry is where extreme caution is important, especially if entering recently. Crypto is perfect example of free market that's being taught all over the world in economics classes. And free market has interesting feature: First-mover advantage and winner takes almost all :).  
So, a lot of people made first moves back in 2015-18 when crypto was under extreme scrunity by banks and regulators, mainly due to its KYC (know your customer) issue. But, with new crypto exchange startups like Coinbase/FTX where individuals details is being assigned to certain wallet that is controlled (semi-control maybe) by exchange, KYC wasn't an issue anymore. So, there are a lot of first mover winners, and now it is quitely forming monopoly, both in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, maybe Metaverse is safe, but with facebook, it is also on the way to be dominated.  

Here is little more details on first move winner dominations. Crypto: Bitcoin has limited supply, and its largest holders are not exchanges, meaning individuals. And they are not many of those individuals, if you wanna check the ownership of the cryptocurrencies, you may go to [intotheblock](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/BTC). The early adopters of bitcoin doesn't need to sell anything to have cash, it has pretty attractive interest rate, around 8-10% APY, basically way more than the bank. Meaning the ownership won't change the hands. Likewise for Etherium/Litecoin/Bitcoin Cash and etc. Similar logic applies to NFTs as well.   

This is feature of free market, it is not something bad. On the other hand, autocratic economy works with hostile takeover. Free market is at least second-best strategy.

Well, will crypto be become really something of future? Yes, it will as a technology.
