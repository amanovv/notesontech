# Cybersecurity

#### Big deal?

I guess cybersec is area where knowing (maybe academic) it and actually achieving (practising it) is pretty distinc, and usually actual white/black hackers will be just high school graduates who love bug bounty programs.  

So, my views here will be mostly as practising.
