# Notes on Tech series :)

## This is series of my thoughts on machine Learning, cybersecurity, and crypto

I have seen many defitions on skillset of machine Learning engineers, full-stack machine learning engineers, or general thoughts on machine learning. What I can tell, those are pretty broad range of defitions which makes ML/AI hype topic, and this is no good for ML community in long term. Mathematician will put too much emphasis on math part of ML, and say it is just linear algebra or linear programming. Statistician will say it is just the data. AI startup founder will say AI is next big thing. Some even think ML will take over the world, imo, only other planetary species will take over the world and if only they need to, given by that time Earth may not have resources worth fighting.   

In terms of skillset, ML engineer mostly will try to use coding as a tool to achieve certain graphs/visualizations and tell background story on it. This creates range of its own issues. 

Some define term of full-stack ML engineer, which inherits the idea from full-stacking of software engineering. ML engineer and software engineer are pretty distinc verticals. Thus, defining full-stack ML based on software engineering will not be accurate at all. 

ML is complicated enough topic, such that, some large AI companies do clumsy engineering with input of billions and quite of manpower, and create services which they can build some corporate brand on. With current technological level of AI/ML and given wave of ML community seems to be directed towards focus of data, the actual dollar value from those services in the long run is bound to shrink exponentially.  

Only hard case examples are from giant companies like Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Apple. Current state of AI seems to be working for them as they are getting value out of it. However, it is hard to reason that the value from those ML/AI related services are actually from AI/ML tech. Apple made $20 cloth and sold millions of it. This doesn't mean clothmaking is great technology or great next business. It is just Apple, bruh, they have been in business almost 3 decades. So, if Apple makes some AI service, they can sell it again, no matter how crappy that service is. 

Another logic behind the hype of current state of AI, is venture capitals are pouring money to AI. I am not sure how many of you had experience with talking people from venture capital. Venture capitals have extremely limited knowledge about AI/ML, almost no idea. 

All these may sound critical of machine learning. Nah, I am not critical of ML, I love the ML, but, the one that is not super intelligence. There is very small intelligence on ML, it is mostly deductions. Intelligence is mostly inductions and abstractions among various parts of life experience. Ye, I am critical of machine learning that is being claimed to be super intelligence or intelligence at all. When something works in this world, it has numerous reasons why it has worked.

To be honest, we as society seem to stuck in interesting vicious loop of education and experimental technology. Learning physics at University, and just to see that physics content at University has almost no correlation to industry. Learning computer science at University to see that industry moves extremely fast, such that the content that you have learnt is already outdated in a year. Same with AI, same with quantum computing in PhD level (5 years to learn technlogy that is too experimental, really?). Education is for sure hard loop to turn around, but if current young generation won't do something on this, it will stay that way for next as well. 

So, I will try to bring almost everything on ML, in this series of written notes which I may eventually make audio.
