# Notes on Tech series :)

## This is series of my thoughts on machine Learning, cybersecurity, and crypto

I have seen many defitions on machine Learning Engineers, full-stack machine learning engineers, or general thoughts on Machine Learning. What I can tell, those are pretty broad range of defitions which makes ML/AI hype topic, and this is no good for ML community in long term. Mathematician will put too much emphasis on math part of ML, and say it is just linear algebra or linear programming. Statistician will say it is just the data. AI startup founder will say AI is next big thing. Some even think ML will take over the world, imo, only other planetary species will take over the world and if only they need to, given by that time Earth may not have resources worth fighting.   

So, I will try to bring almost everything on ML, in this series of written notes which I may eventually make audio.
