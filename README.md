# Notes on Tech series :)

## This is series of my thoughts on machine Learning, cybersecurity, and crypto

I have seen many defitions on skillset of machine Learning engineers, full-stack machine learning engineers, or general thoughts on Machine Learning. What I can tell, those are pretty broad range of defitions which makes ML/AI hype topic, and this is no good for ML community in long term. Mathematician will put too much emphasis on math part of ML, and say it is just linear algebra or linear programming. Statistician will say it is just the data. AI startup founder will say AI is next big thing. Some even think ML will take over the world, imo, only other planetary species will take over the world and if only they need to, given by that time Earth may not have resources worth fighting.   

In terms of skillset, ML engineer mostly will try to use coding as a tool to achieve certain graphs/visualizations and tell background story on it. This creates range of its own issues. 

Some define term full-stack ML engineer, which inherits the idea from full-stacking from software engineering. ML engineer and software engineer are pretty distinc verticals. Thus, defining full-stack ML based on software engineering will not be accurate at all. 

ML is complicated enough topic, such that, some large AI companies do clumsy engineering with input of billions and quite of manpower, and create services which they can build some corporate brand. The actual dollar value from those services in the long run is bound to shrink exponentially.  

Only hard case examples are from giant companies like Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Apple. Current state of AI seems to be working for them as they are getting value out of it. However, it is hard to reason that value from ML/AI related services are actually from AI/ML tech. Apple made $20 cloth and sold millions of it. So, if Apple makes some AI service, they can sell it again now matter how crappy that service is. 

Another logic behind the hype of current state of AI, is venture capitals are pouring money to AI. I am not sure, how many of you had experience with talking people from venture capital. Venture capitals have extremely limited knowledge about AI/ML, almost no idea. 

So, I will try to bring almost everything on ML, in this series of written notes which I may eventually make audio.
